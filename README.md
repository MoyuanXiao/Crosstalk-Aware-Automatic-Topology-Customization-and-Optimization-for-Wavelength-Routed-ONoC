These are the source codes for the paper Crosstalk-Aware Automatic Topology Customization and Optimization for Wavelength-Routed Optical NoCs accepted by TCAD in 2022.

A Note on the Code Quality:
Please be aware that this code was developed during my undergraduate studies as part of my first formal software project. At the time, I had limited software engineering experience. As a result, the codebase is not well-organized. It features some rudimentary practices, such as brute-force loops, and the entire project is contained within a single file.
However, the code faithfully implements the core concepts and algorithms presented in the accompanying paper. The primary contribution of this research is its novel problem-solving methodology, rather than its implementation details. For those looking to replicate the paper's findings, this codebase should serve as a valuable reference.
Skilled programmers with expertise in optimization may be able to achieve superior performance. Based on my current skill set, I am confident that the performance could be improved by an additional 1-3x beyond the significant speed-ups already detailed in the paper.

Disclaimer:
Please use this code with caution. Due to the time that has passed, I cannot guarantee that this version will compile or run correctly, nor can I confirm if it contains every component from the final paper. This code is likely not the final version described in the paper! I unfortunately do not have the time to validate it.
